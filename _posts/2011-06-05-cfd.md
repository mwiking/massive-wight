**A CFD is a financial instrument linked to the underlying share price.**
Consequently, no rights are acquired or obligations incurred relating to the underlying share. You can buy (go long) or sell (go short). The CFD is an agreement to pay out cash on the difference between the opening and closing CFD contract share price.
